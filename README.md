<h2 align="left">Introduction 👋</h2>

###

<p align="left">42 School's mission is to offer a tuition-free, innovative education in coding and computer science through a peer-to-peer and project-based learning model. It eliminates traditional classrooms and teachers, fostering a collaborative environment where students learn by working on real-world projects together. This hands-on approach promotes autonomy, creativity, and problem-solving skills, enabling students to progress at their own pace while developing practical expertise through teamwork and shared responsibility.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Core Principles ✅</h2>

###

<p align="left">You should already be well-acquainted with these fundamental tenets:</p>

###

<h4 align="left">➊ No lectures, no traditional teachers, no MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses).<br><br>➋ Project-centric, hands-on, and collaborative.</h4>

###

<h2 align="left">The Philosophical Foundation of Peer Learning 🌏</h2>

###

<p align="left">Peer learning was designed to reflect the real-world challenges faced by ICT professionals. The idea was to simulate real projects with unique, unpredictable demands, requiring students to solve software problems without any prior instruction. This evolved into a project-driven curriculum, where students take the lead in navigating complex challenges.<br><br>It soon became clear that the skill of seeking out new knowledge and applying it to unfamiliar situations wasn't just valuable to companies—it was a game changer for the students themselves, empowering them with the confidence to tackle anything that comes their way.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Critical Thinking Imperitive 🧠💡</h2>

###

<p align="left">Even experts and educators, despite their deep knowledge, can't know everything in their fields. While they can provide valuable guidance, depending solely on their perspective doesn't build the critical skills needed to navigate the overwhelming amount of information out there. It's crucial to develop the ability to independently filter and apply knowledge to truly thrive in today's world.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Empowering Independence 🧘‍♂️</h2>

###

<p align="left">When it comes to problem-solving, do you want to be someone who can tackle new challenges and create innovative solutions, or just follow predefined instructions? Relying on outside guidance—whether from an expert, teacher, or manual—limits your independence.<br><br>That’s why Peer-Learning is deliberately structured without traditional instructors or set materials. If you aim to master learning and develop flexible problem-solving, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking skills, it's essential to question and engage with every bit of information you come across.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">A Social Constructivist Approach 🤝</h2>

###

<p align="left">The 42 educational model is rooted in social constructivism, a concept promoted by influential educators over the past century. It views the brain not as an empty container to be filled by teachers, but as something shaped through hands-on experience and interaction with others. This approach emphasizes learning through doing and social engagement, rather than passive absorption of knowledge from external sources.</p>
